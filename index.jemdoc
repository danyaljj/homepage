{{<h2 id="themes">Research Themes</h2>}}

My research focuses on the computational foundations of /intelligent behavior/, through the lens of /natural language/. 
My goal is to explore the different ways in which we can develop and evaluate systems that understand and reason with (and about) natural language in different contexts. 
I mostly identify with /natural language processing/ (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP) and /artificial intelligence/ communities (AAAI, IJCAI) and, to some extent, with the /machine learning/ community (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML).

Here are several themes I am interested in: 

- *Generalism[http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/generality/generality.pdf \*]:* 
AlphaGo may be the world champion at Go, although it can't solve any other problem! 
How can we incentivize building models that can address a broader scope of tasks and abilities?  (papers: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08773 ACL'22], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00700 EMNLP-Findings'20])
  # /Papers:/
  #   -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08773 Cross-Task Generalization via Natural Language Crowdsourcing Instructions] (ACL'22)
  #   -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00700 UnifiedQA: Crossing Format Boundaries With a Single QA System] (EMNLP-Findings'20)

- *Self-supervised learning:* 
How can we build task-independent representations that utilize cheap signals available in-the-wild (web data or physical environment) and support better model generalization? (papers: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04304 ACL'20], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03228 EMNLP'18])
  # \n
  # /Papers:/
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04304 Temporal Common Sense Acquisition with Minimal Supervision] (ACL'20)
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03228 Zero-Shot Open Entity Typing as Type-Compatible Grounding] (EMNLP'18)

- *Reasoning:* 
I view "reasoning" as the process of using "reasons" for explaining or justifying decisions. 
How can we enable machines to communicate via /reasons/, for a broad-ranging spectrum of tasks? (papers: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00751  TACL'21], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02235 NAACL'21])
 # \n
  # /Papers:/
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02235 Did Aristotle Use a Laptop? A Question Answering Benchmark with Implicit Reasoning Strategies] (TACL'21)
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00751 Text Modular Networks: Learning to Decompose Tasks in the Language of Existing Models] (NAACL'21)


- *AI + Humans:* With the increased deployment of AI we need to better understand their impacts on humans and foresee the unintended harms that may result:
How can we bake in transparency in models so human operators can contextualize system output? Can we make such transparency into a truly democratic oversight of systems and their algorithmic biases?  Can we build systems that can recourse when there is harm to those that are marginalized? Can we build systems that reduce our socio-political divisions? (papers:  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02428 EMNLP'20], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03538 NAACL'19])
  # \n
  # /Papers:/
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02428 UnQovering Stereotyping Biases via Underspecified Questions] (EMNLP'20)
  #  -- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03538 Seeing Things from a Different Angle: Discovering Diverse Perspectives about Claims] (NAACL'19)


#  - Are system doing what they are supposed to do?
# The sad reality of our current AI technology is that our models, under the hood, often depend on shortcuts that are far from the human decision-making process. 
# Part of my research is dedicated to the ways in which we can bring out their unreliable correlations that could lead to catastrophic errors ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02709 EMNLP 20]). 
# \n
# The tendency of our models to take advantage of problematic correlations could lead to algorithmic bias. No matter how small the implicit biases are in AI systems (say, a resume filtering system), in the long term they would contribute to inequitable #outcomes particularly for the marginalized communities of society. 
# This is an enormous challenge which requires the participation of policy-makers, social scientists, educators, and so on. Likewise, we, AI scientists, should be diligent about addressing problematic aspects of the same technologies we want to sell ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02428 EMNLP 20]).


# AI systems should have the capacity to [http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2019_thesis_defense/danielk_dissertation_2019.pdf /reason/], in ways that are high-level and /not/ attached to individual tasks. 
# During my PhD, I worked towards this vision by creating symbolic systems that effectively utilize the knowledge of their context to solve a given problem ([http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2016_tableilp/2016_tableilp_ijcai.pdf IJCAI 16], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03672 AAAI 18]). 
# More recently, I have pursued the /generalizability/ objective in terms of neural models that can solve a wider range of problems ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00700 EMNLP 20]).

 # - What are more meaningful and effective ways to evaluate the progress of AI?
# We must actively rethink the evaluation of AI systems and  move the goalposts according to the latest developments. I persistently pursue this perspective in order to build more comprehensive challenges for our latest technology. 
# Instances of such vision are embodied in the design of our challenge datasets for language understanding ([https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1023/ NAACL 18], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03065 EMNLP 19], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02235 TACL 21]). 
# Along the same goal, we recently released [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06561 GENIEðŸ§ž], a human evaluation platform to fasciliatet comprehensive evaluation of text generation tasks. 

#  - How can AI benefit the common good?
# Whether we like it or not, technology will play an increasing role in our daily lives. 
# I tend to worry about the unintended consequences of technology in all areas of our lives. 
# These include, but are not limited to, algorithmic biases, misinformation, echo chambers and our growing socio-political divisions. 
# \n
# As a believer in technology, I like to see applications of AI that address the potential damages of new technologies. An instance of such mindset was embodied in our project that explored ways to organize ideas about controversial issues in ways that allows people to see alternative views and help them see alternative views to a discussion ([http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2019_perspectrum/2019_perspectrum_naacl.pdf NAACL 19]).  

# One of the highlights of my research career was the collaboration with a team of brilliant researchers who had [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Combining-Retrieval%2C-Statistics%2C-and-Inference-to-Clark-Etzioni/478b4a5123bd5fda98bb35e6317d7f3555fec97d an ambitious goal of building a machine capable of answering elementary school science questions]. 
# Just a few years ago, the Aristo project [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01958 reached its milestone] by achieving over 90% in 8th grade science â€” [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/artificial-intelligence-aristo-passed-test.html a milestone for AI and NLP].
