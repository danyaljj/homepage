{{<h2 id="themes">Research Themes</h2>}}

Broadly, my research is motivated by *making AI* (1) *helpful* and (2) *efficient*.


In pursuit of these objectives, my team and I have made various endeavors toward the following more specific themes:
 - /Augmentation/: Developing computational models that synergistically augment human experience. The ultimate goal of our work is to benefit humans!
 - /Generality/: Developing models that generalize a broader scope of tasks, abilities, modalities, or environments. Often, the challenge here is the long tail of problems.
 - /Specificity/: Developing models tailored to specific user needs or application domains to offer both utility and efficiency.
 - /Self-supervised learning/ of representations of the world using cheap signals in the wild (web data, physical environment, etc.) in an algorithmically efficient (data and compute) manner.
 - /Reasoning/: Improving models' ability to communicate via /reasons/, for novel problem-solving (recovering from earlier mistakes) and also explainability (using “reasons” to explain or justify decisions).
 - /Interpretability/: Analyzing model operations to help humans understand behaviors, e.g., how does in-context learning emerge or operate? How do LMs balance between `remembering' and `learning'?
 - /Safety/: Making AI more transparent to allow democratic oversight and governance of systems (their algorithmic biases and mistakes) by a population of users.
 - /Interaction/: Effectively engaging with humans and other AI systems for, for example, coordination.
 - /Applications of AI/: We are excited about the increased adoption of AI! We have ongoing work on AI for {science, education, and clinical applications}.

The dominant majority of my research is aligned with the following research communities: /natural language processing/ (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP), /machine learning/  (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML), and /artificial intelligence/ (AAAI, IJCAI).
