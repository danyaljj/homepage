{{<h2 id="about">About</h2>}}

My research focuses on the computational foundations of /intelligent behavior/, through the lens of /natural language/. I mostly identify with /natural language processing/ (ACL, NAACL, EMNLP) and /artificial intelligence/ communities (AAAI, IJCAI) and, to some extent, with the /machine learning/ community (NourIPS, ICML).

My goal is to explore the different ways in which we can develop and evaluate systems that understand and reason with (and about) natural language in different contexts.  
[http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2019_thesis_defense/danielk_dissertation_2019.pdf My thesis] focused on different analyses related to construction of knowledge-aware language comprehension systems that can make effective use of background information from different sources. Parts of my work focused on the Science Exam challenges of the Aristo project ([http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2016_tableilp/2016_tableilp_ijcai.pdf IJCAI 16]). Just earlier this year, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01958 Aristo reached its milestone] by achieving over 90% in Science 8th grade -- a milestone for AI and NLP. 

I tend to worry a lot about the unintended consequences of technology in all areas of our lives. These include, but are not limited to, algorithmic biases, echo chambers in digital spaces, and the contamination of information gateways. More recently, in an effort to mitigate the effect of echo-chambers, we explore ways to organize ideas about controversial issues in ways that allows people to see alternative views and help them have a more open mindset ([http://danielkhashabi.com/files/2019_perspectrum/2019_perspectrum_naacl.pdf NAACL 19]).  

Outside the academic spaces, I am interested in writing for a wider audience, especially on issues at the intersection of policy + AI/tech, and [https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/05/graduation-iranian-immigrant-ban-executive-order-president-trump-daniel-khashabi-philadelphia-ivy-league-upenn beyond]. 

I was a doctoral student at Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania (2017-2019) and at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (2012-2016), under [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/ Prof. Dan Roth]. I have a bachelor's degree from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran Polytechnic (2008-2012). I was greatly fortunate to work with [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tLX51p0AAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Hamid Sheikhzadeh] during my undergraduate studies.
