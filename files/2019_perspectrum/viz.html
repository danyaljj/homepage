While sanctioners will try to target the sanctions the fact is there is nothing to target with sanctions that would not affect everyday lives. Hackers are ordinary people so clearly sanctions will affect others like themselves. The most obvious reactions involve the internet but blocking access to internet services, or penalising ISP’s, or cutting off technology transfers, harm everyone else as much as hackers. Often this harm is in the form of simply making the internet less safe for people in that country because they will have to turn to pirated versions of software. IDC and Microsoft estimate the chances of being infected with malware when using pirated software at one in three  so it is no surprise that the Chinese government in October 2012 launched a campaign to have government and companies purchase legal software.`,

Rather it is carried out by private actors whether this is criminal organisations or businesses seeking to undermine their rivals and learn their secrets this is usually with a financial motive (75% of data breaches) , or else by individuals motivated by nationalism and patriotism to attack those they see as their nation’s enemies. It is difficult to see how sanctions against the nation as a whole affect these groups and individuals. This is certainly the case in China where many such as the ‘China Eagle Union’ admit to hacking for nationalist reasons rather than being told by the government. The hackers only possible response is then more hacking.

That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has.

This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated.

Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%  means 630-700 lives that could be saved. Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia’s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced).

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community.

For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change.

While it is targeted at one country it damages those who are imposing the sanctions as well. A good example of this is Iran. At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

While sanctioners will try to target the sanctions the fact is there is nothing to target with sanctions that would not affect everyday lives. Hackers are ordinary people so clearly sanctions will affect others like themselves. The most obvious reactions involve the internet but blocking access to internet services, or penalising ISP’s, or cutting off technology transfers, harm everyone else as much as hackers. Often this harm is in the form of simply making the internet less safe for people in that country because they will have to turn to pirated versions of software. IDC and Microsoft estimate the chances of being infected with malware when using pirated software at one in three  so it is no surprise that the Chinese government in October 2012 launched a campaign to have government and companies purchase legal software.`,

That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has.

In the same way, the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm. This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated.

Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money.

Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community.

For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change.

While it is targeted at one country it damages those who are imposing the sanctions as well. A good example of this is Iran. At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

Hackers are ordinary people so clearly sanctions will affect others like themselves. The most obvious reactions involve the internet but blocking access to internet services, or penalising ISP’s, or cutting off technology transfers, harm everyone else as much as hackers. Often this harm is in the form of simply making the internet less safe for people in that country because they will have to turn to pirated versions of software. IDC and Microsoft estimate the chances of being infected with malware when using pirated software at one in three  so it is no surprise that the Chinese government in October 2012 launched a campaign to have government and companies purchase legal software.`,

In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated.

Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

Moreover he also concedes “a hunter will carry only a few rounds” so the large capacity magazine is also useless for sport.`,

There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

The UK and US sanctions have not been effective in the case of Myanmar given that the country mainly trades with other ASEAN member states, India, China and Japan. The violation of sanctions often has to do with political motives. In the case of ASEAN, the member countries are concerned that China may use Myanmar for military and naval bases, so they are pouring money into the country and breaking US sanctions to promote their own self-interest in the region and counter China2. Considering that every country has their self-interest in mind, it is ultimately too difficult to forge a united front between enough countries to cripple the country they are sanctioning.`,

Yet this assumption is false: governments have the tools to insulate themselves thereby preventing sanctions from imposing necessary pressure. By keeping all available resources for themselves, the government ensures that the sanctions impact only the people. Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

It is impossible for the people to believe such propaganda is false when there are no competing external claims1. This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community. This is called the &quot;rally around the flag effect&quot; characterized by the banding together of opposing factions because of the adverse actions of an outside power2. For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country.

While it is targeted at one country it damages those who are imposing the sanctions as well. A good example of this is Iran. At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has. It is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way. In the same way, the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm. This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated.

Handguns, being ranged weapons (as opposed to knives), prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them. Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Under the status quo handguns are legal. This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

The point of the American constitution is that it is meant to give an even field to all citizens under the law. Minor differences between people within different states is acceptable; owing to specific needs of specific states and all state legislation must be proved to be constitutional anyway. This difference is specifically problematic because of the nature of its interactions with both the constitution and the law. This change is harmful because the state is dependent upon consistency within the law and perception of the law as being a fair mechanism for all people. Large inconsistencies within the law should not be tolerated as such inconsistencies often bring into debate the legitimacy of the state’s legal code. This is problematic as such debates and inconsistencies can lead to confusion about the reach of the law as well as doubt in the legitimacy of the law. The law is dependent upon citizens understanding and subscribing to the legal code, otherwise legal systems might suffer from problems such as people simply not reporting crime to the police owing to their doubt in the legal system and its ability to protect them, or otherwise law abiding citizens from other areas of the country inadvertently breaking the law by bringing guns into D.C.`,

Murder by gunfire particularly affects children, in total well over a million Americans have died in this manner and 80 people continue to be shot in the states every day. So some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point. Out of 62 mass murders since 1982 almost half the weapons used, 67 out of 142, were semi-automatic handguns and more than 30 were assault weapons. Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%  means 630-700 lives that could be saved. Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia’s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced). In the wake of a mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996 strict gun laws were implemented. An evaluation by the Australian National University found laws saved $500 million and halved the number of people killed by guns saving 200 lives every year.`,

Supenski has testified “because of potential harm to others in the household, passersby, and bystanders, too much firepower is a hazard” as in self defense, the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine. To use an assault weapon would to spray an assailant with bullets from an assault weapon would be using disproportionate force that will not only harm the assailant but will likely hit anyone else nearby. Even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as David Kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting. These weapons are “intended to wound rather than to kill” so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer.

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

The UK and US sanctions have not been effective in the case of Myanmar given that the country mainly trades with other ASEAN member states, India, China and Japan. The violation of sanctions often has to do with political motives. In the case of ASEAN, the member countries are concerned that China may use Myanmar for military and naval bases, so they are pouring money into the country and breaking US sanctions to promote their own self-interest in the region and counter China2. Considering that every country has their self-interest in mind, it is ultimately too difficult to forge a united front between enough countries to cripple the country they are sanctioning.`,

Yet this assumption is false: governments have the tools to insulate themselves thereby preventing sanctions from imposing necessary pressure. By keeping all available resources for themselves, the government ensures that the sanctions impact only the people. Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community. This is called the &quot;rally around the flag effect&quot; characterized by the banding together of opposing factions because of the adverse actions of an outside power2. For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change.

While it is targeted at one country it damages those who are imposing the sanctions as well. A good example of this is Iran. At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

Hackers are ordinary people so clearly sanctions will affect others like themselves. The most obvious reactions involve the internet but blocking access to internet services, or penalising ISP’s, or cutting off technology transfers, harm everyone else as much as hackers. Often this harm is in the form of simply making the internet less safe for people in that country because they will have to turn to pirated versions of software. IDC and Microsoft estimate the chances of being infected with malware when using pirated software at one in three  so it is no surprise that the Chinese government in October 2012 launched a campaign to have government and companies purchase legal software.`,

That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has. It is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way. In the same way, the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm. This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated. In this case the ban is limited to DC however it could potentially extend to other areas in the U.S. which suffer similar problems.2`,

Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

Whilst the constitution might be amended to give a specific change for DC, the rest of the U.S. will still be able to bear arms. The point of the American constitution is that it is meant to give an even field to all citizens under the law. Minor differences between people within different states is acceptable; owing to specific needs of specific states and all state legislation must be proved to be constitutional anyway. This difference is specifically problematic because of the nature of its interactions with both the constitution and the law. This change is harmful because the state is dependent upon consistency within the law and perception of the law as being a fair mechanism for all people. Large inconsistencies within the law should not be tolerated as such inconsistencies often bring into debate the legitimacy of the state’s legal code. This is problematic as such debates and inconsistencies can lead to confusion about the reach of the law as well as doubt in the legitimacy of the law. The law is dependent upon citizens understanding and subscribing to the legal code, otherwise legal systems might suffer from problems such as people simply not reporting crime to the police owing to their doubt in the legal system and its ability to protect them, or otherwise law abiding citizens from other areas of the country inadvertently breaking the law by bringing guns into D.C.`,

Murder by gunfire particularly affects children, in total well over a million Americans have died in this manner and 80 people continue to be shot in the states every day. So some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point. Out of 62 mass murders since 1982 almost half the weapons used, 67 out of 142, were semi-automatic handguns and more than 30 were assault weapons. Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%  means 630-700 lives that could be saved. Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia’s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced). In the wake of a mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996 strict gun laws were implemented. An evaluation by the Australian National University found laws saved $500 million and halved the number of people killed by guns saving 200 lives every year.`,

Supenski has testified “because of potential harm to others in the household, passersby, and bystanders, too much firepower is a hazard” as in self defense, the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine.

Even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as David Kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting. These weapons are “intended to wound rather than to kill” so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer.

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

Yet this assumption is false: governments have the tools to insulate themselves thereby preventing sanctions from imposing necessary pressure.

Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community. This is called the &quot;rally around the flag effect&quot; characterized by the banding together of opposing factions because of the adverse actions of an outside power2. For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change.

At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

While sanctioners will try to target the sanctions the fact is there is nothing to target with sanctions that would not affect everyday lives. Hackers are ordinary people so clearly sanctions will affect others like themselves. The most obvious reactions involve the internet but blocking access to internet services, or penalising ISP’s, or cutting off technology transfers, harm everyone else as much as hackers. Often this harm is in the form of simply making the internet less safe for people in that country because they will have to turn to pirated versions of software. IDC and Microsoft estimate the chances of being infected with malware when using pirated software at one in three  so it is no surprise that the Chinese government in October 2012 launched a campaign to have government and companies purchase legal software.`,

US citizens have been allowed to bear small arms as a symbolic representation of their ability to rise up against state oppression should it ever occur. That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has. It is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way. In the same way, the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm. This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated. In this case the ban is limited to DC however it could potentially extend to other areas in the U.S. which suffer similar problems.2`,

Handguns, being ranged weapons (as opposed to knives), prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them. Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

This difference is specifically problematic because of the nature of its interactions with both the constitution and the law. This change is harmful because the state is dependent upon consistency within the law and perception of the law as being a fair mechanism for all people. Large inconsistencies within the law should not be tolerated as such inconsistencies often bring into debate the legitimacy of the state’s legal code. This is problematic as such debates and inconsistencies can lead to confusion about the reach of the law as well as doubt in the legitimacy of the law. The law is dependent upon citizens understanding and subscribing to the legal code, otherwise legal systems might suffer from problems such as people simply not reporting crime to the police owing to their doubt in the legal system and its ability to protect them, or otherwise law abiding citizens from other areas of the country inadvertently breaking the law by bringing guns into D.C.`,

Murder by gunfire particularly affects children, in total well over a million Americans have died in this manner and 80 people continue to be shot in the states every day. So some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point. Out of 62 mass murders since 1982 almost half the weapons used, 67 out of 142, were semi-automatic handguns and more than 30 were assault weapons. Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%  means 630-700 lives that could be saved. Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia’s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced). In the wake of a mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996 strict gun laws were implemented.

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change.

At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,

That is, to keep a check and balance upon the monopoly of violence that the state has. It is important to note that the state has the monopoly of violence such that it can protect its citizens in the best possible way. In the same way, the right to bear arms exists such that citizens can protect themselves and prevent harm. This means that should the state visit harm upon the citizens of the state then its right to claim a monopoly on violence is revoked and the citizens can fight against the state. In a similar fashion to the above, should the citizens of the state use their right to bear arms to visit harm upon one another, it seems reasonable that in the same way that the state’s monopoly on violence is revoked, the citizens should have their right to bear arms revoked. Given that this does not occur in every single part of the U.S. it also seems reasonable to isolate the ban to areas where the spirit of the right to bear arms is being significantly violated.

Handguns, being ranged weapons (as opposed to knives), prevent people from opting to run away if they are confronted by an attacker and being concealable prevent any attempt at avoiding those carrying them. Because of these unique capabilities they make excellent weapons for gang members who wish to remain inconspicuous to avoid being searched by the police. Further, they are also uniquely useful for other criminal actors such as drug dealers who need to be able to protect themselves, but also need to appear unassuming for clients. As such, handguns, where they are freely available, are often used by most criminals for these purposes. Given  that handguns are also more likely to cause accidental injuries- as a result of incompetence or recklessness- than a knife, it seems logical that handguns cause a much larger harm to citizens in places where they are freely available.4`,

In 1977 the year immediately following the ban the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported robberies, assaults and homicides using handguns had fallen in DC sharply. Further, in 1991 the University of Maryland published a study in the New England journal of Medicine suggesting the gun ban had saved lives in the decade before 1991, claiming that the ban had prevented 47 deaths in DC per year.5 It is theorised that the handgun ban does this because it makes other police tactics, such as stop and search, significantly more effective. If criminals wish to get the tactical advantage of power that opposition mention then they have to carry hand guns in order to do it. However, it means that if they are caught with a gun they become very easily identifiable and can easily be arrested to prevent harm coming to the populace of large. Specifically, the handgun ban means that the police have a much lower burden required in order to arrest suspects and given that a lot of the time the police have a strong idea of who the criminals are, but simply can’t pin them for arrest, such a tactical advantage helps them get dangerous people off the street.`,

This means that should a criminal initially wish to consider mugging someone he has to consider the possibility that he might be shot should he choose to take this action. A visceral fear of death and injury means that a significant number of criminals will be deterred from engaging in burglaries, violent robberies or muggings if they suspect that they might face armed resistance. As such the presence of handguns within a community contributes to the general deterrence of crime within that community.7 Secondly, should someone try to attack someone else with a handgun, if the other person is armed then they are in a much better position to negotiate with their attacker and prevent harm to either party. Creating a public culture in which handguns are held and used sensibly, and in which firearms training is widely available, allows a parity of power to be created between ordinary citizens and criminals. However, this parity of power is changed in favour of the defender. This is because there are more law abiding citizens than criminals. If the mugger is caught by another citizen then it is possible that citizen will also have a handgun leading to a situation where the mugger will likely be arrested or risk death.8 Finally, the normalisation of handguns in society means that people are less likely to panic should they be attacked by a mugger who has one. Deaths from mugging can often be caused by the victim simply panicking in response to the mugger. Shots are often fired by desperate and unstable assailants who are unprepared for their victim’s reaction. In a society acclimatised to handguns and aware of the risk they present, incidents of this type- fuelled by panic, uncertainty and fear- are much less likely to occur.`,

The point of the American constitution is that it is meant to give an even field to all citizens under the law. Minor differences between people within different states is acceptable; owing to specific needs of specific states and all state legislation must be proved to be constitutional anyway. This difference is specifically problematic because of the nature of its interactions with both the constitution and the law. This change is harmful because the state is dependent upon consistency within the law and perception of the law as being a fair mechanism for all people. Large inconsistencies within the law should not be tolerated as such inconsistencies often bring into debate the legitimacy of the state’s legal code. This is problematic as such debates and inconsistencies can lead to confusion about the reach of the law as well as doubt in the legitimacy of the law. The law is dependent upon citizens understanding and subscribing to the legal code, otherwise legal systems might suffer from problems such as people simply not reporting crime to the police owing to their doubt in the legal system and its ability to protect them, or otherwise law abiding citizens from other areas of the country inadvertently breaking the law by bringing guns into D.C.`,

To put things into the general context of gun crime within the United States every year 17,000 people are killed, 70 percent of them with guns and nearly 20,000 people commit suicide by shooting themselves . Murder by gunfire particularly affects children, in total well over a million Americans have died in this manner and 80 people continue to be shot in the states every day. So some form of gun control is necessary and a ban on assault weapons is a good starting point. Out of 62 mass murders since 1982 almost half the weapons used, 67 out of 142, were semi-automatic handguns and more than 30 were assault weapons. Taking the low estimate of 1% of deaths from assault weapons that still means 90-100 people a year while the high 7%  means 630-700 lives that could be saved. Australia shows the advantages on implementing restrictions on guns (in Australia’s case much stricter than anything being contemplated in this debate so the effect would not be as pronounced). In the wake of a mass shooting in Port Arthur in 1996 strict gun laws were implemented. An evaluation by the Australian National University found laws saved $500 million and halved the number of people killed by guns saving 200 lives every year.`,

Law enforcement expert Leonard J. Supenski has testified “because of potential harm to others in the household, passersby, and bystanders, too much firepower is a hazard” as in self defense, the defenders will often fire until they have expended all the bullets in their magazine. To use an assault weapon would to spray an assailant with bullets from an assault weapon would be using disproportionate force that will not only harm the assailant but will likely hit anyone else nearby. Even those who are against an assault weapons ban such as David Kopel concede that for the most part these are not useful weapons for hunting. These weapons are “intended to wound rather than to kill” so would certainly not be useful in taking down a deer.

                    label: `<b>Evidence:</b> Underage drinking is a major problem in the world that has claimed many lives. There are multiple ways to die from alcohol: alcohol poisoning, drunk driving, and many other ways. No doubt about it, alcohol just starts trouble. Have you ever wondered what the leading reason for car crashes is? It isn’t texting or any usage of the phone. It is fully driving under the influence. Millions of Americans are pulled over and given a ticket for driving under the influence. People also die from alcohol poisoning, this number having been the leading cause of death in certain countries. In America, the death rate for alcohol poisoning in our youth has sky-rocketed in the past few years. It isn’t the leading cause but it is definitely one of the many causes of death that could easily be prevented. Many lives have been saved by the law that people under the age of twenty-one are unable to ingest alcohol. Scientists have found more than 25,000 lives have been effected (positively) by this law. Some people try to say that parents should be able to give their children small doses of the alcohol because it is in a controlled environment. Although, this isn’t always true. Some children may like the taste, and then sneak what to them appears to be a little bit but is actually a lot. Then they can eventually die from alcohol poisoning. When you are around the teen\preteen age, your brain is maturing. Alcohol damages the maturing process by killing brain cells. You may think that it ends at the age of eighteen, but you’d be incorrect. The maturing process is believed to end around the age of twenty-five. People say that if the alcohol age is lowered than it will make alcohol seem less appealing to children because of the adage “People want what they can’t have.” Although this may seem true, which it is, it will most likely make younger people drink which then rises the death rate from alcohol poisoning by a whopping amount. This law is put out for safety and completely based upon age. You may look and realize how low other countries drinking ages are. Depending on the country some don’t have a drinking age limit at all. You may think that those countries do well, but they have a lack of government. One of those countries is Jamaica, the only place in the world where it is legal to smoke pot. Many of the laws in those other countries are lacking structure; many even lack government. That should make it common sense that we shouldn’t be like those types of countries, many of which are a part of the developing world. They are poor people whom spend all of their money on alcohol, when they could be buying resources like food, water, clothing, and or shelter. Parents don’t normally worry about their kids getting into alcohol because they believe that they have shielded them well enough so that they know better. Truth is children are ignorant and unknowing. People also think that their children don’t have access to alcohol, but when it comes right down to it, putting it on the top shelf won’t stop them. They have resources from school and other places such as (if you live in a big city) they can get it from almost any street side marketer. In 1996, 308 children died from alcohol poisoning; in 1997, 342 children died from alcohol poisoning; and in 1998, 300 children died from alcohol poisoning. As you may already be noticing, this is a very real issue amongst teen and young adults. Not only was in made illegal to drink alcohol under the age of 21, but you weren’t allowed to buy it or handle it either. Although, 19 states messed up when writing the law; instead of saying that drinking alcohol underage is illegal, they said that public possession and purchase were to be illegal. This law never mentions underage drinking, yet people still don’t do it in those states. This shows that people know what not to do, proving that it is only an act of common sense. The law was there before Prohibition, but wasn’t really enforced. Many children would drink on a regular basis and think nothing of it, but after Prohibition, it was considered a misdemeanor. It became impossible not to enforce because after the drinking age was lowered the rate of automobile crashes rose at an alarming rate. When government official found out about this number they changed the drinking age to twenty- one, and made sure to enforce the law so that the number would go down. Although this is true, some people believe that it is already developed enough to drink at the age of twenty- one. If some people believe that twenty- one may even be too young, how can eighteen even be close? It is a proven fact that the human brain is fully developed by the age of twenty- five. Many people argue with that fact and have tried to prove it wrong a many of times. When it comes right down to it, they are arguing with science and when the brain is fully matured, not arguing that the legal drinking age should be lowered. People get offended when you tell them that they aren’t old enough to do something, and teens don’t really even care if they can drink or not. In the end, they just don’t want to be told that they can’t do something. Drinking will end someone’s childhood. Sometimes it will end more than just the kid’s childhood. Some parents think that it is OK for their children to drink under their supervision, so they allow them to do so. But, in reality, it is harmful for children, or anyone for that matter, to drink. Good parents do not allow their children to drink alcohol even under their supervision which is a smart thing to do. The best thing for parents to do is to not even talk about alcohol because that will make their children want it more. The best thing to do is to create a modern day Buddha out of your child. You have to tell them some things, but keep quiet when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Studies have shown that over fifty percent of children, who die from an alcohol and or drug related death, have parents that are alcoholics or various other types of addicts. Many people have become interested in this topic. There are people on either side of the argument, but many more people appear to be siding with the no drinking side. So many lives have been saved by this law; in fact, this law has saved more lives than most laws combined. It has become noticed that in the past month 26.4% under-aged people have use alcohol, and binge drinking among the same age group was 17.4%. this shows how unknowing and inattentive parents can be. If a child knows that they will be able to do something that they are not supposed to, they will do it. Peer pressure is a huge factor of alcohol abuse amongst teens. Recently, a news station did a report on peer pressure. They had three kids under video surveillance and they had a man drive up in an ice cream truck. After the kids got their ice cream the man asked if they wanted to see a tour of the truck. The first two kids went into the truck without hesitation. The third kid was very cautious, but even he got in the truck. It is the same way with alcohol, if 90% of a party is drinking, chances are the other 10% will start drinking as well because they feel left out or uncool. Drinking alcohol is like putting poison in your body. It will hurt you no matter what age you are. Sometimes it will affect your mind, other times your body. People don’t realize what damage one drink can do to them because they haven’t ever read a document like this before. People who drink don’t even realize how much it will affect their social status, no one will want to hang out with them and or even be their friend. Some people will even laugh at them as a sign of disrespect. It is sad to see this happening to someone, but you must know that it is their own fault. People whom drink alcohol regularly are generally unhappy, unwanted, unloved, just plain old disliked. Don’t be the town drunk, but don’t be the person who pities him either. Drinking has ruined the economic lives of many as well. You may be out driving around doing errands or something and see a man hold a cardboard sign asking for money. Facts about this man are probably that he has bad luck, he is unemployed, and he is an alcoholic. You may be thinking that these are just a bunch of stereo-types, but in reality studies have proven these to be true. It has also been proven that if you give them money they will loose it, have it stolen from them, spend it on beer or drugs, or just waste it. It has been proven that they only use it for something useful 18% of the time.`,

If sanctions are only imposed by a few countries, the sanctioned nation can replace lost trade from those countries with trade from other allies, deflecting the economic consequences of the sanctions. North Korea is so isolated from the international community that sanctions have had little effect, particularly because their most important trade partner, China, has continued to do business with them1. The UK and US sanctions have not been effective in the case of Myanmar given that the country mainly trades with other ASEAN member states, India, China and Japan. The violation of sanctions often has to do with political motives. In the case of ASEAN, the member countries are concerned that China may use Myanmar for military and naval bases, so they are pouring money into the country and breaking US sanctions to promote their own self-interest in the region and counter China2. Considering that every country has their self-interest in mind, it is ultimately too difficult to forge a united front between enough countries to cripple the country they are sanctioning.`,

Yet this assumption is false: governments have the tools to insulate themselves thereby preventing sanctions from imposing necessary pressure. By keeping all available resources for themselves, the government ensures that the sanctions impact only the people. Governments that can achieve this deflection have a relatively powerless citizen base that even when they are suffering have difficulty standing up to the government. Punishing innocent people is immoral, because they are suffering for a crime they did not commit. When the US and UK placed sanctions on Saddam Hussein, it lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, although the exact number is contested. Considering that US ultimately invaded Iraq, these children died in vain. In North Korea, it is thought that sanctions have led to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of people. In both Myanmar and North Korea most of the pain from sanctions is deflected onto the largely helpless population who have little ability to put pressure on their oppressive governments to stop the suffering1. Because this suffering often does not affect the leadership, they can essentially ignore any pressure to reform2. And, many of these governments simply don&#x27;t have an interest in improving the lives of their people, making sanctions immoral and ineffective3.`,

This blocks the flow of outside information into a country and permits dictators to mercilessly use propaganda to strengthen their own position. It is impossible for the people to believe such propaganda is false when there are no competing external claims1. This propaganda can deflect blame for the economic suffering from the government to the international community. This is called the &quot;rally around the flag effect&quot; characterized by the banding together of opposing factions because of the adverse actions of an outside power2. For example, sanctions in Myanmar will only serve to insulate the SPDC, the ruling party, in power. The SPDC&#x27;s grip on the national media means that it is able to disseminate propaganda which demonizes the West as the enemy of the Myanmarese, and casts the military junta as their hero. This can make the people more willing to stand up to the Western powers instead of their government. The lifting of sanctions may ensure that ordinary Myanmarese citizens are exposed to Western technology, labor practices and political ideologies which in turn will equip them with the belief and self-determination necessary to engineer change in their own country. The power of media cannot be underestimated, and isolation of sanctioned countries jeopardizes the opposition movements in that country integral to regime change. This threat ultimately outweighs potential benefits of sanctions.`,

While it is targeted at one country it damages those who are imposing the sanctions as well. A good example of this is Iran. At the moment there are scanctions on Iran by the EU and US meaning that despite being a major producer of oil and gas Iran does not export much of it. For the EU in particular this has serious consequences. There are very few options for importing gas; Algeria and Lybia provide a little, some is domestic (from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway) and the rest comes from Russia or Central Asia through Russia. The only alternative is liquified natural gas from Qatar which is both very expensive as it needs to be cooled to be liquified and transported before being warmed up again for use at the other end, it can also be highly explosive and therefore dangerous. This leaves dependence on Russia or Iran. Iran could help build and fill a pipeline to Southern Europe (Nabucco) that is already being constructed but because of sanctions it cannot take part despite being the obvious partner. This forces Europe to rely on Russia to meet our rising demand for gas supplies. Russia has already demonstrated that allowing them to have a monopoly on our gas supplies is dangerous by regularly cutting off supply to Eastern European and former soviet states. Russia has also succeded in cutting off the possibility of filling nabucco with gas from central asia by winning contracts to sell on the gas from Central Asian states. The only way out of this would be to drop sanctions on Iran so that we can get our gas from there and prevent our dependence on Russia. This would benefit both of our economies rather than harming both as the sanctions are doing. Prices would come down due to competition so benefiting us while some revinues would go to Iran.`,
